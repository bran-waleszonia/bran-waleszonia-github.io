                <p>
                    Let me introduce myself real quick. My name is Brandon Waleszonia and was born and raised in Central
                    Arkansas.
                    I attended Sheridan High School located in Sheridan, Arkansas. I would have graduated in 2006 but
                    went
                    ahead
                    and obtained my G.E.D.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2008, I enlisted into the United States Army, as an infantryman, and attended One Station Unit
                    Training
                    (Basic and AIT together) at Fort Benning, Georgia. I would graduate around July of 2008, and ship to
                    my
                    first
                    duty station, Fort Myer, Virgina. I spent 4 years stationed there, and performed numerous
                    ceremonies,
                    and final
                    honors within Arlington National Cemetery. I eventually volunteered to become a Tomb Guard at the
                    Tomb
                    of the
                    Unknown Soldier and earned my Tomb Guard Identification Badge, <a
                        href="https://tombguard.org/guards/form" target="_blank"><strong>Badge #589</strong></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My next assignment was at Fort Campbell, Kentucky with the 101st Airborne Division. I finished out
                    my
                    contract there
                    and left service and moved back to Arkansas. I started going to school, first as a pre nursing
                    student
                    but changed my
                    major and started delving into coding and IT related course. Life happened and I ended up leaving
                    school
                    and working
                    full time. From healthcare, electrical work, law enforcement and security. I've now decide to jump
                    back
                    in and try to
                    switch careers and this is my first step.
                </p>

                    I appreciate you reading my short biography, and come follow along with me on this journey!
